 Warning: SkewedWakeCorrection encountered a large value of chi (93.909 deg), so the yaw
 correction will be limited. This warning will not be repeated though the condition may persist.
 See the AD15 chi output channels, and consider turning off the Pitt/Peters skew model (set
 SkewMod=1) if this condition persists.
