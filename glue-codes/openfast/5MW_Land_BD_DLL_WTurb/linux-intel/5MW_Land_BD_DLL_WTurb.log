 Running InflowWind.

    Reading a 31x31 grid (145 m wide, 17.5 m to 162.5 m above ground) with a characteristic wind
    speed of 12 m/s. This full-field file was generated by TurbSim (from
    OpenFAST-v3.0.0-98-g7bde6b54) on 14-Sep-2021 at 11:49:55.

    Processed 1442 time steps of 20-Hz full-field data (72.05 seconds).
