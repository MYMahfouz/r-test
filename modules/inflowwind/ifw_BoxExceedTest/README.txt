This is a placeholder for testing the full-field wind box exceedence.  This is used for points requested by the LidarSim and OLAF modules.

To execute:
   Windows:    InflowWind_Driver.exe /BoxExceedAllow IfW_CheckGrid.inp
   Linux/Mac:  inflowwind_driver -BoxExceedAllow IfW_CheckGrid.inp

This will produce a single time slice of YZ with extents beyond the edge of the wind file information.
